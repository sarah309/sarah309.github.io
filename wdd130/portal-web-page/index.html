        <p>I am a Computer Science major. I want to pursue a career in technology because I think it is important and useful knowledge to have.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to learn about Web Development. I took a couple classes like this in Middle School and High School and I enjoyed them.</p>
        <p>Outside of school I enjoy hiking and being outside. I love warm sunny days and warm cloudy days and warm days with a light breeze so Spring is definitely the best time of year for me to be here!</p>
