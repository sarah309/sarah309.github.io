      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        College life leaves little time for students to prepare healthy meals
        each day. I created this website so college students can find healthy
        recipes that are quick, delicious, and affordable.

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn. You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <table class="colors">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Primary</th>
            <th>Secondary</th>
            <th>Accent 1</th>
            <th>Accent 2</th>
          </tr>
          <!-- Switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there. -->
          <tr>
            <td class="primary"></td>
            <td class="secondary"></td>
            <td class="accent1"></td>
            <td class="accent2"></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This site is geared toward college students that feel overwhelmed from
        classes, assignments, jobs, extracurriculars, social obligations, and
        the many other accruing responsibilities that come from living on their
        own. Because of the difficulties students face with finding time to
        prepare healthy meals, fast food and processed snacks often become the
        norm from day to day. This website offers students quick, affordable,
        and nutritious recipes so they can enjoy balanced meals on a college
        schedule.

      <h3>Recipes</h3>
      <p>
        Breakfast Overnight Oats: Ingredients Rolled oats Fruit of choice (I
        suggest frozen mixed berries) Coconut water Add oats and fruit to bowl,
        and enough water to barely cover. Stir. Let sit in fridge overnight.
        Enjoy the next morning! Lunch Veggie Sandwich: Ingredients Bread Any
        veggies/condiments you’d like Recommendations: Cucumber Tomato Mushrooms
        Onion Lettuce Dill pickles Mustard dressing Hummus Instructions Assemble
        your sandwich with the veggies and condiments of your choice and enjoy!
        Dinner Curry: Ingredients 2 cloves garlic (or 1 Tbsp garlic powder) 1/2
        large onion (or 3 Tbsp dried minced onion) 3-4 large potatoes 1 tbsp
        curry powder 1 tsp garam masala (optional) 1 tsp turmeric 1 can light
        coconut milk 1 tbsp tomato paste 5 oz fresh or canned tomatoes 1/2 - 1 C
        peas (I use frozen) Large handfuls of spinach Brown rice (as much as you
        want) Instructions Dice potatoes into large chunks (no need to peel) and
        add to a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and then reduce
        heat to lowest setting. In a separate pot, add rice (1 C dried brown
        rice produces about 2 1/2 C cooked rice) with enough water to fill the
        pot (about 6 C water per 1 C rice). Add chopped onion and minced garlic
        to rice (if you’re using dried, wait until later step before adding).
        The rice will be cooked in a similar way that you’d cook pasta. Bring
        rice to a boil and then reduce heat to lowest setting. With the burners
        on medium-low, if you let the rice and potatoes sit for an hour they
        should be good to go for the next step. A fork should easily go through
        the potatoes, and you can taste test the rice to see if it’s been cooked
        to your preference. Drain the rice (I just use the pot lid, open it just
        a crack and pour out the water.) Put the pot back on the stovetop (with
        burner off). Pour most (about 3/4) of the potato water out. Return to
        stovetop on medium-low setting. Mash the potatoes until your preferred
        consistency (I enjoy mine a little chunky). Add garlic powder and onion
        powder (if using) to potatoes. Stir. Add coconut milk, tomato paste,
        diced tomatoes, and spinach. Stir. Once it starts simmering, add
        remaining spices. Add the frozen peas as late as possible (they lose
        their bright green color if cooked for long). Stir. Enjoy your potato
        curry over the brown rice.
