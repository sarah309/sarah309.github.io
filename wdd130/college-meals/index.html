          <h3>
            This site is geared toward college students that feel overwhelmed
            from classes, assignments, jobs, extracurriculars, social
            obligations, and the many other accruing responsibilities that come
            from living on their own. Because of the difficulties students face
            with finding time to prepare healthy meals, fast food and processed
            snacks often become the norm from day to day. This website offers
            quick, affordable, and nutritious recipes so students can enjoy
            balanced meals on a college schedule.
