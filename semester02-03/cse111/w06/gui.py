# The controls in a graphical user interface (GUI) are called widgets,
# and each widget is an object. Because a GUI has many widgets and
# each widget is an object, the code to make a GUI usually has many
# variables to store the many objects. Because there are so many
# variable names, programmers often adopt a naming convention to help
# a programmer keep track of all the variables. One popular naming
# convention is to type a three letter prefix in front of the names
# of all variables that store GUI widgets, according to this list:
#
# frm: a frame (window) widget
# lbl: a label widget that displays text for the user to see
# ent: an entry widget where a user will type text or numbers
# btn: a button widget that the user will click
